#Libraries are pieces of code that someone has already written, that you can use them.
#You do so using modules
#Modules are just libraries which with one or more function built in it
#No need to even write the same functions in each file
#Just import a library which contains that file
#Eg: random.py comes pre-intalled with python
#docs.python.org/3/library/random.html
#import keyword allows you to get a function form some file
#random.choice(seq)
#seq means a list, number or string, etc
