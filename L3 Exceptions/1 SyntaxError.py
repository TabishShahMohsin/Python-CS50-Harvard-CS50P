#Exceptions means errors in your code
#Starting from Syntax Errors
#Eg: print("Hello World)
    #SyntaxError: unterminated string literal
    # This means that there is something wrong with the syntax
    # Unterminated stands for not clossing a bracket or quote
    # String stand for the input type of string
    # Literal means the typed thing (Wello World)
