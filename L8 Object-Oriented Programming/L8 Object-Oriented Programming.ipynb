    "1. **Classes and Objects**:\n",
    "   - A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Custom Data Types**:\n",

    "   - This example defines a `Student` class, representing a student with attributes `name` and `house`.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Attributes are variables associated with an object.\n",
    "   - Instance variables are unique to each object created from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "- The code demonstrates creating a `Student` class and using it to manage student data in an organized manner.\n",
    "- The class currently has no methods, serving as a basic structure for data representation."

    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. **Dunder Methods**:\n",
    "   - Special methods in Python, surrounded by double underscores (e.g., `__init__`).\n",
    "   - The `__init__` method is used as a constructor to initialize an object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instance Variables**:\n",
    "   - Variables unique to each object (instance) of a class.\n",
    "   - Represent an object's state, defined using `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Instance Methods**:\n",
    "   - Functions defined inside a class that operate on an instance's attributes.\n",
    "   - Automatically take `self` as the first parameter.\n",
    "   - Provide additional functionality for interacting with or modifying the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Validation**:\n",
    "   - Ensures input data is correct during object creation.\n",
    "   - Uses custom error handling (`ValueError`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Example Use Case**:\n",
    "   - This example manages student data, validates input, and demonstrates instance methods for interacting with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Instance Variable VS Class Variable**:\n",
    "   - Class variables are shared by all instances like a common trait (e.g., all dogs are Canis), while instance variables are unique to each object (e.g., each dog has its own name).After they are created differently, changing any one doesn't affect the other.\n",
