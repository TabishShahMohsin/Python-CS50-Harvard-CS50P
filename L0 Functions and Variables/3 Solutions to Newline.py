#seeing the documentation of a function
#eg: seeing at python .org:
#  print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
#these are preferrably called as name parameters and not the arguments
#*objects implies that it may take infinite no. of strings
#sep=' ': By defulat if 2 arguments are passed they are seperated by a space.
#end=' \n': By default it shifts the printing cursor to the next new line.
#may use single or double quotes most of the times
a="Tabish"
b="Shah"
print(a+" "+b)
print(a, sep="-" ,end=" ")
print(b)
print(a,b)
print(f"Tabish {b}")
#must write f before
